      "message": "since these are specific to tpaas, and it\u0027s the tpaas as a service usecase that decides where they go, why not call them tpaas_inbound_mirror_ids and tpaas_outbound_mirror_ids.\n\nIdeally, i\u0027d like them to be called post_filter_inbound_mirror_ids and rename the old inbound to pre_filter_inbound_mirror_ids, but we did something stupid in storing them in text format in zk, so changing the name isn\u0027t an option :/. As such, I think it\u0027s better to not use pre/post at all and just use the actual use case.",
