      "message": "since these are specific to tpaas, and it\u0027s the tpaas as a service usecase that decides where they go, why not call them tpaas_inbound_mirror_ids and tpaas_outbound_mirror_ids.\n\nIdeally, i\u0027d like them to be called post_filter_inbound_mirror_ids and rename the old inbound to pre_filter_inbound_mirror_ids, but we did something stupid in storing them in text format in zk, so changing the name isn\u0027t an option :/. As such, I think it\u0027s better to not use pre/post at all and just use the actual use case.",

      "message": "Since this is blocking this patch from going in, let\u0027s settle.  AFAIK, these fields are intended to be used by midonet API, not just tap-as-a-service.  So from midonet API\u0027s point of view, do these naming indicate the actual use case?  If we are bound to the naming of the existing mirror fields, I think they do as long as we make it clear what the current mirror fields mean.  If we want to ignore the existing fields, perhaps \u0027post_filter_inbound_mirror_ids\u0027 and \u0027pre_filter_outbound_mirror_ids\u0027 might be good candidates.  Thoughts?",
