MDTS - MidoNet Distributed Testing System
=========================================

MDTS provides the testing framework for [MidoNet](https://github.com/midonet/midonet).

It will exercise MidoNet system using [Midonet Sandbox](https://github.com/midokura/midonet-sandbox)
(docker containers management framework) to simulate multiple hosts, including
Neutron, multiple MidoNet Agents, multiple Zookeeper and Cassandra instances 
and Quagga servers. 
On top of this simulated physical topology, we can generate whatever
virtual topology we need to test using both the Neutron API models (networks,
subnets, ports, security groups, etc.) or the internal Midonet API counterparts
(bridges, routers, ports, chains, etc.)
It will then run a suite of tests using python testing frameworks to inject
traffic into the simulated network while simultaneously checking state and
end-to-end transmission.

Minumum recommended environment
-------------------------------

* 8GB RAM
* 20GB storage space
* 2 CPUs (or VCPUs)

Prerequisites and MDTS package dependencies
-------------------------------------------

They can be installed automatically using the following script (only need
to run once).
Most run-time dependencies are now handled inside the docker containers so the
software requirements for the host are basically related to compile-time
dependencies (e.g. protobufs).

```
midonet/tests$ ./setup_test_server
```

If manual installation is needed, please refer to this script for a
comprehensive list of all the required packages.

You also need the python-neutronclient and the python-midonetclient installed 
on your host so MDTS can access both API servers (Neutron or Midonet) through
the python API. However, as this package is part of the Midonet packages, 
you need to install it once you compile/generate the packages.

Running Sandbox
---------------

To run MDTS, first start the Midonet Sandbox subsystem. Midonet Sandbox depends
on the MidoNet packages. If they're needed to be installed manually,
please build them as follows from the midonet root tree:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
./gradlew clean
./gradlew -x test debian
find . -name "*.deb"
./midonet-cluster/build/packages/midonet-cluster_5.0~201509181011.8599820_all.deb
./midolman/build/packages/midolman_5.0~201509181011.8599820_all.deb
./python-midonetclient/python-midonetclient_5.0~201509181011.8599820_all.deb
./midonet-tools/build/packages/midonet-tools_5.0~201509181011.8599820_all.deb
```

Install the python-midonetclient on the host:
```
sudo dpkg -i ./python-midonetclient/python-midonetclient_5.0~201509181011.8599820_all.deb
```

Midonet Sandbox already use a predefined set of docker images to ease the task
of spawning different Midonet components. To start using sandbox and build the
initial set of images, you need to:

```
pushd midonet-sandbox
sudo python setup.py install && popd
pushd tests
sudo sandbox-manage -c sandbox.conf build-all default_v2 && popd
```

Wait until all images have been generated. The default_v2 is a basic MDTS
flavour for sandbox. Look into the sandbox/flavours directory for a list of the
supported flavours. For more information about how to use sandbox, components,
flavors and overrides, check its [source repo](https://github.com/midokura/midonet-sandbox)
or execute `sandbox-manage --help`.

Copy all packages inside the corresponding override so Sandbox knows which
packages to install:
```
cp midolman/build/packages/midolman*deb tests/sandbox/override_v2/midolman
cp midonet-tools/build/packages/midonet-tools*deb tests/sandbox/override_v2/midolman
cp python-midonetclient/python-midonetclient*deb tests/sandbox/override_v2/cluster
cp midonet-cluster/build/packages/midonet-cluster*deb tests/sandbox/override_v2/cluster
cp midonet-tools/build/packages/midonet-tools*deb tests/sandbox/override_v2/cluster
```

And start sandbox with a specific flavor, override and provisioning scripts:
```
pushd tests
sudo sandbox-manage -c sandbox.conf run default_v2 --name=mdts --override=sandbox/override_v2 --provision=sandbox/provisioning/all-provisioning.sh
```

To completely remove all containers to restart sandbox:
```
sudo sandbox-manage -c sandbox.conf stop-all --remove
```

Running functional tests
------------------------

You're now set to run MDTS tests:

```
pushd tests/mdts/tests/functional_tests
./run_tests.sh
```

Refer to documentation in [`run_tests.sh`][run_tests] for further information.
