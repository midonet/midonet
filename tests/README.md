The MDTS system has moved to:

http://github.com/midonet/mdts

Under the 'mdts' directory.  Please see the documentation on that 
github page.

Any tests and utilities here are in-tree tests under development 
maintenance and are necessary for development testing proceudre.
They should be maintained along with the code itself and updated
as per development policies.

These tests require MDTS python libraries to function, located at
the above github address.  Please use the mdts_cbt script to 
easily launch and run the tests in this directory (see the 
documentation on the github page for more information).
