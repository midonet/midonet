This is subtle and the two pieces are far apart from each other. It\u0027s not obvious at all.",

Seems wrong that we propagate the seen fields to wcFlow.wcmatch, which may or may not be origMatch. Moreover, failure to propagate means we wildcard too much, which is a correctness bug, doesn\u0027t packet workflow query flow match fields in Coordiantor-less code paths?",
