      "message": "I dunno, I\u0027m not strong on this, but I was thinking that by labeling it \"non-voting\" we know the purpose of this list.  A voting MDTS may require a different set of tests, if it existed, for instance.  It explains the reasoning behind why these tests are included in particular versus other MDTS tests (like an MDTS_ALL set) or something.  Do you have a suggested alternative name?  Like MDTS_FOR_GATE or something?",
