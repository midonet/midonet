      "message": "Yep, we need the minion to be up as soon as possible so when the agent finishes initialization and tries to load the flow state from the minion, it is up and running. Bootstrapping the curator framework takes a while.\n\nFor the purpose of this patch, I think it\u0027s ok to call getConfiguratorFromArgs within this method (after starting the minion) instead of on the main method so we don\u0027t change the init work flow. What do you think?",
