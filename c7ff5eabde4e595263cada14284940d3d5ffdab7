      "message": "It\u0027s a requirement by Zoom, which requires all the models to have an \"id\" field to be persisted via Zoom. If we want to keep this data around in ZK, we need this field. It\u0027s fine that Neutron does not populate it, the translator can fill in whatever we think is appropriate (most likely a host ID).",

      "message": "ID is not necessary in the sense that this PortBinding doesn\u0027t really need to be stored in ZK. Coming to think about it, it should be populated by neutron to whichever value it think is suitable (most likely host ID?).\n\nThat we keep id and other fields \"optional\" is for a different, more or less practical reason. I.e., if we make the id field \"required\", it needs to be populated at the time of building, but it\u0027s more convenient to be able to pass around partially constructed objects.",
