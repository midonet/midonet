/**
 * An Aggregator is an aggregation component that groups a bunch of individual
 * observables. It exposes a protected API to manipulate the aggregation,
 * adding or removing observables transparently to subscribers.
 * The completion and errors in the individual observables are not propagated
 * to the aggregated observable; therefore, any completion/error notifications
 * should be converted into an 'onNext' event in order to reach the final
 * subscriber.
 * NOTE: data from observables added before a particular subscriber is
 * subscribed is ignored.
 *
 * @tparam KEY is the observable Id type (the key to distinguish the 'source'
 *            observables)
 * @tparam TYPE is the type of the elements emitted by the observables
