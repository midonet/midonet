mm-ctl(1) -- Midolman command line interface
============================================

## SYNOPSIS

`mm-ctl` [--config <file>] [--command] [<args>]

## DESCRIPTION

**mm-ctl** is a command line interface to manage Midolman.  It is not a client
of the REST API, and it does not provide interfaces to manage datapath.
It is, however, a client of the MidoNet data cluster, and furthermore, it
is meant to provide all CLI functions with the abstraction level that sits somewhere
in between the REST API and datapath.  It is useful for certain operations
needed by cloud orchestration systems to run directly from the hypervisor
host.

## OPTIONS

  * `--config` <file>:
    Midolman configuraiton file path.  If not supplied,
    **/etc/midolman/midolman.conf** is used.

## COMMANDS
  These are option commands in which one of them must be supplied.

  * `--bind-port` [<PORT_ID>] [<DEVICE_NAME>]:
  Bind a virtual port to a local device.

  * `--unbind-port` [<PORT_ID>]:
  Unbind a virtual port from its mapped device.

## EXAMPLES
