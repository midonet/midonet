## Maintenance of the openvswitch integration layer

### Overview

Midolman network controller lives on top of a programmable switch we refer to as
"the datapath". In its current architecture, midolman knows and exploit the
low-level functions of this datapath module to route packets and control traffic
in and out of virtual ports it manages. This tigthly coupled architecture
requires a certain level of maintenance. This document gives pointers to
places that can break and needs monitoring.

### Southbound netlink facing interface

At the moment, the only datapath interaction we support is the netlink based
interface to openvswitch kernel module. When used together, the netlink and odp
layers allow midolman to start a client connection to the kernel datapath module
over a netlink socket. Midolman can then send message to the datapath to create
and bind virtual ports, create flows for routing packets in and out of virtual
ports, and receive new packet events from the datapath.

The protocol used by midolman to talk to the datapath is generic netlink.
Details about the available commands and objects that clients can exchange with
the openvswitch datapath module can be found in openvswitch source code in
/include/linux/openvswitch.h. This header file defines integer constants which
are used to serialize and deserialize msg over the netlink connection between
clients and the datapath. All these constants needs to be referenced in
different places in midolman code. For this purpose the OpenVSwitch java
interface found in the org.midonet.odp package should be used instead of
directly hard-coding the values in the code. This eases maintenance and helps
keep the codebase in sync with itself and with openvswitch.

When a new version of openvswitch needs to be supported in midolman, the first
step is to take a diff of /include/linux/openvswitch.h and see if some
constants were changed or dropped. In general, the netlink interface should be
pretty stable, but non-compatible changes between versions can happen (for
example, the drop of port-based-tunneling in ovs 1.10). When changes are
required, most of them would be in the odp layer. On top of this, changes in
the midolman layer may be required (see next paragraph).

### Northbound actor facing interface

Several midolman actors and classes know about the odp layer and which kind of
actions can be invoked there. A non-exhaustive list of these entities:

- the DatapathController actor, which creates, reads and deletes ports, flush
flows at starti-up, and initializes the datapath instance in the kernel space if
it was not created yet before midolman started.

- the FlowController actor, which installs, reads and deletes flows based on
existing WildcardFlow instances.

- the PacketWorkflow class, which also installs and deletes flows, and on top of
this can push back packets to the datapath to "execute" them with associated
flow actions (like tunneling or local forwarding)

- the Deduplication Actor, which like the PacketWorkflow can execute packets and
which receives uplink call from the datapath kernel module when new unknown
types of packets needs to be handled.

- the FlowTranslator trait, which creates a list of FlowAction from a list of
"virtual" actions defined at the virtual topology level after a simulation
successfully returned.

- the WildcardMatch class, which can be instantiated from a list of FlowKeys
that represent information that the datapath module collected after inspecting
packets headers at different L layers.

Unfortunately this "northbound" interface is not standard and is hard to
maintain in its current form. Ideally the odp layer interface presented to
midolman actors should be as close as possible to dpif (DataPath InterFace).
This would allow to use midolman controller layer against different datapath
implementation (like intel dpkg based datapath). Information about functions
available at the dpif layer can be found in /lib/dpif.h and /lib/dpif-provider.h
in the openvswitch source code directory.
