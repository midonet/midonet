# Floating IPv6 to Fixed IPv4

## Overview

Starting with release v5.4, MidoNet supports to map a floating IPv6
address to a host with a fixed IPv4 address.

The Operations and Deployment docs will cover the user-facing aspect of
the feature, so this document is aimed at MidoNet developers and
explains some of the internal implementation details.

## Quick-Start

MidoNet floating IPv6 is aimed to allowing hosts from the IPv6 Internet
to connect to IPv4 tenant instances. Use the following steps to setup
a virtual topology for floating IPv6.

1. Create a provider router.

<pre>
neutron router-create provider-router
</pre>

2. Create an IPv6 uplink network and subnet. In principle, these will
use a globally routable IPv6 prefix. In this example, we use `2001::/64`
as the uplink IPv6 prefix.

<pre>
neutron net-create uplink-network \
    --provider:network_type uplink

neutron subnet-create \
    --disable-dhcp \
    --ip-version 6 \
    --name uplink-subnet \
    uplink-network 2001::/64
</pre>

3. Create a port on the uplink network. This port will be bound to
the physical uplink interface, `<UPLINK>`. The IPv6 address assigned to
the port will be `2001::2`. We denote by `<UPLINK-PORT-ID>` the
identifier of the uplink port, and by <HOSTNAME> the name of the gateway
host.

<pre>
neutron port-create uplink-network \
    --binding:host_id <HOSTNAME> \
    --binding:profile type=dict interface_name=<UPLINK> \
    --fixed-ip ip_address=2001::2
</pre>

4. Add a router interface from the provider router to the uplink
network.

<pre>
neutron router-interface-add provider-router port=<UPLINK-PORT-ID>
</pre>

5. Ensure that the uplink port is reachable from the IPv6 Internet. If
the IPv6 subnet assigned to the uplink network is not globally routable,
add the corresponding routes on the remote systems as needed.

<pre>
ping6 2001::2
</pre>

6. Create a public external network to interconnect the provider and
tenant routers. This must have an IPv6 subnet that is also globally
routable. In this example, we use `1000::/120` as the public IPv6
prefix.

<pre>
neutron net-create public-network \
    --router:external true

neutron subnet-create \
    --name public-subnet \
    --ip-version 6 \
    public-network 1000::/120
</pre>

7. Create a tenant router.

<pre>
neutron router-create tenant-router
</pre>

8. Set the tenant router gateway to the public external network.

<pre>
neutron router-gateway-set tenant-router public-network
</pre>

9. Create a tenant private network and subnet. We use the private IPv4
subnet `192.168.0.0/24`.

<pre>
neutron net-create tenant-network

neutron subnet-create \
    --name tenant-subnet \
    tenant-network 192.168.0.0/24
</pre>

10. Add a router interface from the tenant router to the tenant network.

<pre>
neutron router-interface-add tenant-router tenant-subnet
</pre>

11. Create an instance port on the tenant network. We denote by
`<INSTANCE-PORT-ID>` the identifier of this port. Set the port's MAC
address to the one of the physical interface that will be bound to this
port.

<pre>
neutron port-create tenant-network
</pre>

12. Create a floating IP for the instance port on the public network.

<pre>
neutron floatingip-create \
    --port-id <INSTANCE-PORT-ID> \
    public
</pre>

13. In VPP add a default route for the IPv6 Internet. This route should
route traffic via the uplink interface identified as
`host-vpp-<UPLINK-PORT-ID-FIRST-EIGHT-DIGITS>`, e.g. `host-vpp-f8f94c54`.

<pre>
vpp# ip route add 0::/0 via 2001::1 host-vpp-f8f94c54
</pre>

14. If using veth pairs, disable checksum offloading on source and
destination interfaces, as needed.

<pre>
ethtool -K <INTERFACE> tx off rx off
</pre>

## Architecture

To implement support for IPv6, MidoNet leverages VPP, a open source
project aiming to provide the virtues of Vector Package Processing to
routers and network equipment. See [fd.io](http://fd.io) for details.

### Floating IPv6

Floating IPv6 is a feature that allows a Neutron tenant to connect a
private IPv4 network to the IPv6 Internet via an IPv6 external
network, by assigning floating IPv6 addresses to the IPv4 instances.
This allows inbound IPv6 connections from the Internet towards IPv4
instances.

The key concept behind the implementation of floating IPv6 addresses
for IPv4 tenant networks is Stateful NAT64[1], which allows IPv6-only
clients to contact IPv4 servers using unicast UDP, TCP, or ICMP, with
no changes required in either the IPv6 client or the IPv4 server.

The following figure illustrates the scenario for a Neutron topology
using floating IPv6.

Clients to IPv4 Servers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6146)

### IPv6 Packet Pipeline

Because OVS is not able to translate between IPv4 and IPv6 packets
(there are no actions to replace the IPv4 header with an IPv6 one and
vice versa), the NAT64 is performed exclusively in a VPP pipeline,
configured by the MidoNet Agent according to the current virtual
topology.

The following figure illustrates the IPv6 pipeline. The pipeline is
logically divided into 3 stages:

1. Uplink: Inbound IPv6 packets at the uplink interface are intercepted
in OVS by a flow rule, and forwarded to VPP via an uplink veth pair.

2. NAT64: VPP, being configured with the NAT64 addresses for the
corresponding tenant routers, translates the IPv6 packets to IPv4.
 
3. Downlink: VPP forwards the XLAT-ed packets to OVS via a downlink veth
pair. Here, the first packet of every flow is set to MidoNet for
simulation, whereas subsequent packets will match an entry in the OVS
flow table and be forwarded to the destination.

</pre>

### Uplink Setup

The IPv6 uplink is configured for every exterior router port with an
IPv6 address. When the MidoNet Agent detects an uplink port, it takes
the following actions:

* It starts a local VPP process, if one not already started.

* It creates an uplink veth pair for the corresponding uplink interface.
  The veth pair consists of an `ovs` interface that is bound to the OVS
  datapath, and a `vpp` interface that is connected to VPP.

* It installs an OVS flow rule that will forward the packets ingressing
  at the uplink interface with an IPv6 header to the `ovs` interface,
  and a rule that will forward the packets ingressing at the `ovs`
  interface to the uplink.

       |
     uplink
</pre>

### Downlink Setup

The IPv6 uplink has a corresponding IPv6 downlink which carries
IPv6-to-IPv4 translated traffic back to OVS, and carries IPv4 traffic
which needs translation to VPP. The packets traversing this path are
VxLan encapsulated, with the VNI respresenting the tenant router for
whom the translation is being done.

The downlink consists of:

* A veth pair
  - One end is connected to VPP and assigned the address
    169.254.124.1/30.
  - The other end is assigned 169.254.124.2/30. It is _not_ attached
    to OVS.

* A vxlan tunnel port, created in OVS with UDP port 5231.

### Example packet path

In the following example:
  * IP6 source is 3001::1/64
  * IP6 dest is 2001::1/64
  * IP4 source range is 100.64.0.0/10
  * IP4 dest is 192.168.0.1
  * Tenant VNI is 345
  * Tenant VRF is 12
  * eth0 is the uplink port on the gateway.
  * Gateway underlay IP is 172.16.0.1
  * Compute underlay IP is 172.16.0.2
  * The 5231 tunnel port is port 7 in OVS

#### Ingress packets

1. A packet, **[IP6{src=3001::1,dst=2001::1}/Payload]** enters eth0.
2. The packet enters OVS.
  * OVS matches the packet against the ipv6 flow, forwards to VPP.
3. The packet enters ip6 lookup node in VPP.
  * The packet matches the fip64 adjacency in the fib, and is
    forwarded to ip6-fip64.
4. ip6-fip64 looks up 2001::1 in its translation list. Finds that it
   belongs to the tenant with VRF 12
  * ip6-fip64 allocates 100.64.0.1 from the IP4 source range.
  * the packet is rewritten as
    **[IP4{src=100.64.0.1,dst=192.168.0.1}/Payload]**.
  * the TX vrf is set to 12.
  * the packet is sent to ip4-lookup.
5. ip4-lookup does a lookup for the packet in VRF 12.
  * It finds an adjecency that sends the packet to a bridge domain
    which contains a vxlan interface configured with tunnel 345.
6. vxlan adds a vxlan header to the packet
  * Packet now looks like
    **[IP4{src=169.254.124.1,dst=169.254.124.2}/UDP{src=5231,dst=5231}/VXLan{VNI=345}/IP4{src=10.0.0.1,dst=192.168.0.1}/Payload]**.
  * vxlan forwards the packet to ip4-lookup, with TX vrf set to 1
7. ip4-lookup finds an adjacency for 169.254.124.2, since downlink-vpp
   is on vrf 1
  * the packet is sent via downlink-vpp.
8. The packet appears at downlink-tun.
  * the linux kernel sees that is a udp packet with dst port 5231.
  * the kernel pushes the packet to the ovs tunnel port for 5231.
9. OVS cannot match the packet to any flow.
  * The packet is sent to the upcall handler.
10. The midonet agent receives the packet.
  * The flow match contains
    TunnelKey{tunnelid=345, ip4src=169.254.124.1, ip4dst=169.254.124.2}.
  * The agent uses the tunnelid to find the port on the tenant router
    from which simulation should start.
11. The agent starts simulation of the packet from the port.
12. The rest of the simulation occurs as normal.

### Egress packets

1. Normal simulation has occurred to the point where the packet enters
   the tenant router.
  * The packet is currently
    **[IP4{src=192.168.0.1,dst=10.0.0.1}/Payload]**.
2. The packet matches the route for 100.64.0.0/10 and is sent to the
   route's port.
3. The port has a list of all gateway hosts with active ipv6 uplink
   ports.
  * It selects one of these gateways and forwards the packet there,
    via a tunnel.
  * The tunnel key used is the tenant router VNI.
  * Packet is
    **[IP4{src=172.16.124.2,dst=172.16.124.1}/UDP{src=6677,dst=6677}/VXLan{VNI=345}/IP4{src=192.168.0.1,dst=100.64.0.1}/Payload]**.
  * 6677 is vxlan_overlay_udp_port in agent config.
4. The packet arrives at the gateway host.
  * It enters OVS through the vxlan overlay port.
  * It doesn't match anything, so is sent to the upcall handler.
5. The packet enters midolman.
  * The flow match contains
    TunnelKey{tunnelid=345,ip4src=172.16.0.2,ip4dst=172.16.0.1}.
  * The agent knows from the tunnel key, that this is a packet for ip6
    translation.
6. The agent creates a flow to send the packet to VPP.
  * The flow contains the actions
    SetKey{TunnelKey{tunnelid=345,ip4src=169.254.124.2,ip4dst=169.254.124.1}}
    & Output{Port=7}.
  * The packet is executed with the same action.
  * The packet now appears as:
    **[IP4{src=169.254.124.2,dst=169.254.124.1}/UDP{src=5231,dst=5231}/VXLan{VNI=345}/IP4{src=192.168.0.1,dst=100.64.0.1}/Payload]**.
7. The packet traverses the 5231 tunnel port and enters the kernel.
  * The kernel forwards the packet to 169.254.124.1 via downlink-tun.
  * The packets enters VPP.
8. ip4-lookup sees this is a vxlan packet so forwards to vxlan.
  * vxlan sees that the VNI is 345, so sets the TX vrf to 12.
  * vxlan strips off the vxlan headers.
  * The packet now looks like
    **[IP4{src=192.168.0.1,dst=100.64.0.1}/Payload]**.
  * vxlan forwards the packet to a bvi loopback device, which passes
    it to ip4-lookup.
9. ip4-lookup forwards the packet to ip4-fip64.
10. ip4-fip64, using the vrf and packet parameters, translates the
    packet to ip6.
  * The packet now looks like **[IP6{src=2001::1,dst=3001::1}/Payload]**.
  * The packet is sent out the uplink interface, eth0.

### State sharing
Several uplink ports of the same PR might be attached to different
VPPs. For resilent connection these VPPs must share the information
about all ipv6<->ipv4 mappings. When one midolman goes down, another
one can still translate its packets.

To accomplish this on each new ipv4 allocation VPP will send to
 "all another vpps that share same PR" a UDP packet with the following body:

</pre>
The version field is equal to 1 for now and will be increased for any future
 updates.
Two operations are supported for now: 0 - ADD mapping, 1 - DELETE mapping.
We make operation field 2 bits wide to accomplish possible new operations (
 for example: UPDATE)
The VNI of downlink port will be provided by "fip64 add" command so all VPPs
 share the same set of VNIs. The VNI is used by remote VPP to find a
 corresponding downlink port. We cannot guaranty the downlink ports will have
 the same VRF on different midolmans. The fixed ipv4 address is included
 to allow remote VPP figure out which fip6 is accessed by this ipv6 client.
Some packets might be lost on the way, but it is not a big deal given
 most of them will reach its destination.

## Configuration

## VPP implementation

The VPP version used is a modified version, forked from VPP v16.09 and available
at:

    https://github.com/midonet/vpp

Two nodes has been added: ip4-fip64 and ip6-fip64. These nodes implement the
translations, making use of MAP-T functionality of VPP.

The node tree is basically the following (double border boxes are nodes
introduced in the new functionality and single border ones are preexisting in
VPP. Transitions to error-drop node not shown):

* IPv6 to IPv4 (from Internet into cloud):
<pre>
                 .----------------------.
              .->|  ip6-map-t-tcp-udp   +-.
              |  `----------------------· |
.===========. |  .======================. |  .------------.
| ip6-fip64 |-+->|    ip6-fip64-icmp    |-+->| ip4-lookup |
`===========' |  `======================' |  `------------·
              |  .----------------------. |
              `->| ip6-map-t-fragmented +-·
                 `----------------------·
</pre>

* IPv4 to IPv6 (from cloud to Internet):
<pre>
                 .======================.
              .->|  ip4-fip64-tcp-udp   |-.
.===========. |  `======================' |  .------------.
| ip4-fip64 |-+                           +->| ip6-lookup |
`===========' |  .======================. |  `------------·
              `->|    ip4-fip64-icmp    |-·
                 `======================'
</pre>

The related files in the forked VPP repository are:

<pre>
    vnet/vnet/fip64/
    vnet/vnet/fip64/fip64.c
    vnet/vnet/fip64/fip64.h
    vnet/vnet/fip64/ip6_fip64.c
    vnet/vnet/fip64/ip4_fip64.c
</pre>

## Midolman implementation

A new actor is in charge of managing the Midonet VPP service, starting it under
demand on notification on the creation of a router port with IPv6 (usually from
a tenant router).

The following steps are done in that case:

 1. Start the VPP process: to assure it runs from a known state, any other VPP
    process (initiated or not by Midonet) are killed, so the listening port
    (5002) is available for the new VPP process. So, having another VPP
    instances in the same host is not recommended.
 2. Link OVS and VPP with the uplink (a dedicated veth pair)
 3. Link VPP and midolman with the downlink (a dedicated veth pair).
 4. Install needed flows in OVS to redirect IPv6 traffic to VPP through the
    uplink.

Although not all of them used, there are utility methods to communicate to OVS
in a more direct way, and utility methods to communicate with VPP using a Java
interface.

## Neutron integration

Despite not done yet, the target is that the IPv6 FIP could be configured by
using neutron command that will be forwarded by the Midonet Neutron plugin to
the Midonet Cluster (API) that will translate to Midonet specific configuration
data.
