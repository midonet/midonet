## Flow invalidation in Midolman

### Precis

In order to direct virtual network traffic Midolman installs flow matches on
its local OVS kernel datapath. The flow matches are computed by simulating the
traversal of the virtual network devices by one of the flow's packets. The flow
matches are simple forwarding rules that represent the outcome of complex
decisions taken during simulation. Most packets in a flow are forwarded by the
installed flow match (no simulation of the virtual network is performed).

An installed flow match will become stale or incorrect when the virtual device
configurations change such that a new simulation of the flow's packet cannot
possibly yield the same forwarding decision. Stale flow matches will persist
on the switch as long as their flows are active and will continue to forward
packets according to the old configuration.

Midolman's goal is to invalidate any stale flow match within a few seconds of
the configuration change that made it stale. If the flow is still active, one
of its packets will then be injected into the network simulation and a new flow
match will be installed on the Kernel datapath.

Identifying the set of all, and only, the stale flow matches due to a
configuration change is a hard problem. When this cannot be done precisely,
Midolman's approach is to invalidate a superset of these flows: all the flows
that traverse the virtual device whose configuration has changed.

### Motivation

Packets should traverse the virtual network, be dropped or answered, or arrive
at their destination in a manner consistent with the current network
configuration. The behavior of virtual network traffic should respond within
seconds to a change of the network configuration.

### Caveats

Instantaneous invalidation of incorrect flow matches implies recomputation and
will result in a spike in resource utilization by Midolman as well as a
temporary spike in the latency of recomputed virtual network flows.

Because of our coarse approach to invalidation (which in some cases invalidates
all flow matches whose packets traversed the modified virtual network device), the
network's temporary performance degradation is uncorrelated to how many flow
matches are truly incorrect after the configuration change. Only the number of
active flows traversing the device matters.

### Implementation

We will implement flow invalidation using tags. Tags are case classes extending
from FlowTag.

There are two kind of flows, wildcard flows and kernel flows. Wildcard flows are
understood only by MM and are semantically more powerful because you can use
wildcards. A wildcard flow is translated into one or many kernel flows.
Kernel flows are flows that the kernel can understand, no wildcard is allowed.

Tags can be applied only to wildcard flows. A single tag may be applied to many
wildcard flows. Likewise, many tags may be applied to a single wcflow.
When any component that gets to touch the simulation object may tag the wcflow.
The FlowController is only responsible for keeping track of the tag-flow
associations, and implementing the invalidate-by-tag. To invalidate a wcflow
it will be necessary to pass a tag to the FlowController and it will take care
of deleting all the corresponding flows.

The DatapathController will tag the flows using two tags, one for the in-port
and one for the output port. These tags will be stored internally by the
DatapathController and specify the short port number. That way the DatapathController
doesn't deal with virtual network IDs or concepts, and we can leave that to the
SimController, Coordinator and simulation objects.

Every virtual object that will get a packet during the simulation can add one or
more tag to the PacketContext. At the end of the simulation all the tags will
be passed to the FlowController, that will use them to tag the flow installed.

FlowTagger is the class that will take care of keeping the tagging semantic
coherent. Every object that need to tag a flow, will request a tag from the
FlowTagger. The FlowTagger uses a per-thread cache to avoid unnecessary tag
allocations.

### Implementation Details

Ports are treated as network elements so that the removal or modification
of a port only results in the invalidation of matches for flows that traversed
that port. Otherwise, we would have to invalidate all the flows of the port's
parent device.

Rule chains are considered network elements for convenience (since any flow that
traversed a device also traverses its filters). However, since rule chains can
be shared across devices, invalidating by chain ID makes it unnecessary to track
all the devices that share a chain that has been deleted/modified.

Here is an analysis of changes that trigger flow invalidation, listed according
to the virtual device affected by the change. When we mention configuration change
we refer to:
 - the device was assign a new chain
 - some entry in the config file changed

#### Port
##### Port configuration in ZK
There's no need to react to Port addition/deletion because flow invalidation will
be performed by BridgeManager and RouterManager, responding to changes in the
MacLearningTable and RoutingTable respectively

configuration changes -> invalidate all flows tagged with this port ID

Tagging in Coordinator using the ID of the port
Invalidation in PortManager

##### Port becomes active or inactive on a host

Port added -> do nothing

Port deleted ->

           1) bridge port

                      - materialized -> BridgeBuilderImpl will take care of the flows
                                      invalidation, watching the MacLearningTable

                      - logical -> BridgeBuilderImpl will notice that the
                                 rtrMacToLogicalPortId changed and will invalidate
                                 the flows

           2) router port -> the router will react to that because its routes will
                          change

Tagging in Coordinator (it a packet goes through a port, the Coordinator will tag
                       it using the port id)
Invalidation Bridge or Router

#### Datapath Port

DPC will tag the flows involving one port using the short port number of that port.

A port is added -> do nothing
A port is deleted -> invalidate all the flows tagged with this port number

Tagging and invalidation performed in DatapathController

#### Bridge
Every bridge will tag every packet it sees using its bridge id.

Configuration change -> invalidate all flows tagged with this bridge id

Change in the list of exterior ports -> invalidate all flows that were flooding the bridge.

Additionally, bridge-flooding flows get tagged with every port they send to, making them
react to changes in the list of ports or in the contents of any individual port.

##### Exterior ports
React to the changes in the MAC learning table

    1) A new association {port, mac, vlan id} is learnt -> invalidate all flows tagged
                                                (bridgeId, MAC, VLAN ID)

    2) A MAC entry expires -> invalidate all the flows tagged (bridgeId, oldport,
       MAC, VLAN ID)

    3) A MAC moves from port1 to port2 -> invalidate all the flows tagged
       (bridgeId, port1, MAC, VLAN ID)

##### Interior ports
Added -> Invalidate all ARP requests for the port's MAC.
         Invalidate all flooded flows to the port's MAC, tagged (bridge ID, MAC,
         VLAN ID)
Removed -> Remove all the flows tagged (bridge ID, port ID). Where port ID is
           ID of bridge's logical port

Tagging in Bridge.
Cases:

    1) unicast packet for the L2 network, tag = bridgeId, MAC destination,
        port destination id

    2) broadcast packet, tag = bridge ID

    3) a packet for a logical port, tag = bridge ID, port ID

Invalidation in BridgeManager

#### Router
Every Router will tag every packet it sees using as tag its router id.

Configuration change -> invalidate all flows

It will tag every packet using two tags:(router id, destination IP) and
(router id, route hash). It will pass to the FlowController a tagRemovedCallback.
The router will store internally a trie of the destination ip of the packets
it has seen. It will use the trie to be able to detect which flows to invalidate
if a route is added to the routing table. The FlowController will fire the
tagRemovedCallback when a tag is removed because the corresponding flows get
deleted, so that the RouterManager will be able to clean up the trie of destination
IP.

Route added -> invalidate all the flows whose tags correspond to the ip destination
               affected by this new route (the sub tree that has this route as root)

Route deleted -> invalidate all the flows whose tag is this route

Tagging: Router
FlowInvalidation: The RCU Router will use a callback to pass the tag added to the
                  PacketContext to the RouterManager. RouterManager will take
                  care of flow invalidation and of keeping the ip destinations
                  trie up-to-date.

#### Chain
When a packet is filtered through a Chain, the Chain will add its ID to the tags.

If a chain get modified all the flows tagged by its ID need to be invalidated

#### LoadBalancer

LoadBalancer will tag all packets which traverse it.

These flows will be invalidated in the following cases:
* LoadBalancer configuration changes
* VIPs or VIP configurations change

#### Pool

Pool will tag all packets which traverse it.

These flows will be invalidated in the following cases:
* Pool configuration changes
* Pool Members or Pool Member configurations change

*NOTE:* When a PoolMember is set to admin state down, or removed, existing
connections should be allowed to continue, although no new traffic will
be directed to that PoolMember.
