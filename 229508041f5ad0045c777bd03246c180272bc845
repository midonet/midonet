      "message": "Re: \"Each server knows the network ID it\u0027s responsible for.” and \"It takes *that*...\"\n\nThis talks about a single network ID and therefore contradicts the statement made a few lines above:\n\"A single instance of the server serves all neutron networks on the host.”\n\nAlso: \"It takes that and the source IP of the metadata request to identify the instance (VM)”\nis misleading because the Network ID isn’t really used at this point.\n\nTherefore I suggest re-writing the bullet point as follows:\n\n\"Each server maps the source IP address of the incoming request to a specific VM instance ID. Further on we’ll see that MidoNet translates each VM’s private address to a uniquely selected address so that the address alone (without the Network ID) is sufficient to identify the VM.\"",
