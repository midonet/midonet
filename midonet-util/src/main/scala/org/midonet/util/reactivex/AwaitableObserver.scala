 * Trait to be mixed into an Observer that can be awaited.
 * The `awaitCompletion()` method blocks the calling thread until the stream
 * finishes or the timeout expires. The `awaitOnNext()` method blocks the
 * thread until the specified number of calls to `onNext()` are made or until
 * the stream terminates, correspondingly returning true or false. It is also
 * subjected to a timeout. The `reset()` method allows the instance to be reused.
