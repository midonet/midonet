/**
  * This class implements a block writer for writing arbitrary data on an
  * array of byte buffers (blocks). It supports arbitrary header formats
  * exposed in [[BlockHeader]]. This block writer takes care of
  * allocating a new block from the pool when necessary.
  *
  * WARNING: This is not thread safe. The behaviour is undefined if more
  * than one writer uses the same underlying ring buffer. For flow state
  * local storage, we should only have one writer at a time so it's not a
  * big issue.
  *
  * @tparam H Type of the block header used to write block headers.
  * @param blockBuilder The builder for CRUD ops on the block header.
  * @param buffers The pool where the buffer blocks are written.
  * @param expirationTime Expiration time in nanoseconds, same precision as
  *                       used by [[org.midonet.util.concurrent.NanoClock.DEFAULT]]
