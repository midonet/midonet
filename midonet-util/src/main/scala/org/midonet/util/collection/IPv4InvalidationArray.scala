/*
 * A data structure to track IP addresses whose flows should be invalidated
 * upon a routing table change.
 *
 * It stores IP addresses along with their reference counts and the prefix length
 * of the route that match them.
 *
 * Stored IPs can be ref'ed/unref'ed as flows come an go. The data structure
 * offers the list of affected IP addresses by a routing table change.
 *
 * Empty values are represented as IPv4InvalidationArray.NO_VALUE both internally
 * and to the outside. The underlying value for that constant is very implementation
 * dependent, because entries in the data structure encode both the reference
 * and the prefix length in a single int.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *
 *   * Implemented as a naive 256-arity trie, with no compaction optimizations.
 *   * Bits below /28 are ignored, making invalidation a bit coarser optimal
 *     as a speed/memory vs precision trade-off. For this reason the 4th level
 *     nodes are 32-element arrays. A fully expanded trie would take 1GB of
 *     memory, as opposed to 16GB if the full 32 bits were tracked.
 *   * Levels 3 and 4 of of the trie use object pools to prevent allocations.
 *   * Levels 1 and 2 are allocated up front and never freed, this is 257 pointer
 *     arrays of 256 positions each.

         * is added. Because the stored corrected match length (1) is not <= the
