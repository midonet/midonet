The update set the Midonet object\u0027s pool_id equal to the one in the Neutron object.\n\nNow, having seen the code, I know that it\u0027s the first one. But this test doesn\u0027t really test that behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, I\u0027m not sure how you would test that behavior without simulating what I assume would be an unrealistic Neutron task (one where the pool_id in the Neutron object doesn\u0027t match what was already in the Midonet object). So I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s anything that should be changed here.",
