With the bug, if you simply called \u0027getSecurityGroup\u0027 and \u0027getSecurityGroupRule\u0027, you would have gotten the exception, which would have failed the tests.  I think the tests we need here are just to test the get* methods (check the object returned by get* instead of checking against exceptions).",
