I agree this is a nice time-saver for not having to load the container, but it just adds redundant fields in the topology (the port is already a large object).\n\nBtw, the container service already provides this information via the ContainerPort class. If you hook that into the RoutingManagerActor (as you did in a different patch), then you should already know whether a port is for a quagga container.",
