Worse, its also passed into flowInvalidation.invalidateFlowFors, which would call the implicit _again_ thus allocating again. implicits are bloody dangerous.\n\nPerhaps you could create a nat key factory, that you pass to natKeyFromSbe. have one method on it (like the apply method) that creates the concrete NatKey class that we use in the agent.",
