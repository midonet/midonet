      * Assuming the subscription happens at t0, the subscriber will immediately
      * receive one child Observable for each child node that is known at t0 by
      * the cache. These child Observables will in turn emit a single ChildData
      * with the latest known state of the child node.
      *
      * All child node removals happening at t > t0 will cause the corresponding
      * child observable to complete. All child node additions happening at
      * t > t0 will result in a new child observable primed with the initial
      * state being emitted to the subscriber.
      *
      * Connection management is delegated to the underlying PathChildrenCache,
      * which will deal with reconnections. Therefore no errors will be emitted
      * on the observable.
      *
      * TODO: consider whether we want to make that conditional to some timeout,
      *       if the connection doesn't come back in X, signal the onError so
      *       subscribers have the chance to react accordingly.
