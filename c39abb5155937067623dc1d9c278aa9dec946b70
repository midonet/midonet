      "message": "Okay, so I just need to double check.  We really are changing this value from literal \"2\" to \"16\", correct?  It WAS being treated as a binary 010, but now will be treated as a hexadecimal 0x010?  Will this affect other code that uses this flag which is now drastically changing in value?  Was there a failure that was being caused by the fact that this value had the incorrect value?",
