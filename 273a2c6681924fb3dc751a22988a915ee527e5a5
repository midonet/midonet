      "message": "Turns out that this is unnecessary.  You cannot create a gateway device with remote mac tables.  You can only insert it one at a time.  So let\u0027s just create a port.\n\nTo not waste this code, we could just define a new model for remote mac with the following fields:\n\nid,  (unique ID)\ndevice_id, (gw_device ID)\nmac_address,\nvtep_address, (IP addr)\nsegmentation_id\n\nand implement create/delete API (delete is with the \u0027id\u0027 field). But we can put that in separately.",
