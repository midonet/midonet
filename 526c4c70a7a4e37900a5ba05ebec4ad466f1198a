I remember we had to add a custom reader to the REST API, when we upgraded jersey in the past.\n\nThe underlying cause here is that there\u0027s no reader for the \"plain/text\" media type. We could have added one to the client, but it seemed like too much trouble for just reading an input stream and convert it to a string.",
