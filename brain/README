# Midonet Brain

This module contains the Midonet Controller that is charge of all control plane
functions.  It abstracts communication with storage systems and low level
devices.

## General design considerations

TODO

## VTEP support

The midonet-brain currently provides a simple API for interaction with an
OVSDB instance holding a VTEP schema.  This depends internally on a custom fork
of the odl-ovsdb plugin, modified to run outside of an OSGI container.

The API is defined at VtepDataClient, which declares operations intended
to interact with the VTEP to configure a VxGW. These include:
- addLogicalSwitch: creates a new Logical Switch in the given VTEP.
- bindVlan: associates a Midonet network to a given Logical Switch.

## ODL-OVSDB dependency

This project needs a package containing our fork of the ODL library. The
odl-ovsdb directory contains a git submodule referencing the correct commit on
our fork of this project. It has a modified build that minimizes dependencies on
external odl modules.

By having the code as a submodule, we can also run all tests as part of ordinary
unit test runs of the midonet project. We also keep a reference to the specific
version of the code used at any given point in time from MN.

Note that in order to compile Midonet successfully, you will need to execute:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

before the build. This will fetch the right version of the submodule code and
use it to build the right dependency packages.
