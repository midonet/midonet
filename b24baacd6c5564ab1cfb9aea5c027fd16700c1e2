      "message": "I might be wrong, but just thinking about it off the top of my head, I think a change to a different part of the build.gradle file that happened to have \"midonetVersion\" added would also count as a \"version bump only\" change with this grep.\n\nSo, \n\n  - \u0027rhelTarget \u003d \"7\"\n  + \u0027rhelTarget \u003d \"midonetVersion \u003d \"5.0.0-rc6\"\"\n\n(or anything similar) seems like it might still miss the full check.\n\nBasically we are checking that + and - are the same (so it\u0027s a single change, not an add or remove) and that the added portion has \"midonetVersion\" in it, but not checking that the removed portion also had midonetVersion in it.\n\nAgain, this is a very unhappy-path edge case, but I\u0027ve seen stranger things happen with vi and fat fingers before. :)  Should be caught in code review, sure, but just in the name of completeness...",
