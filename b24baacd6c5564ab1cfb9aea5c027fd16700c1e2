      "message": "Mike, here you suggested:\n\n if [ \".$FOR_UNIT\" \u003d\u003d \".0\" ]\n  then\n      echo \"$DESC_NO_CHANGES\"\n      echo \"$FAST_BUILD\"\n      exit 0\n  fi\n\nNote that a FOR_UNIT \u003d\u003d 0 doesn\u0027t imply that FOR_MDTS \u003d\u003d 0. This snippet would skip MDTS tests if, for example, I just edit an MDTS test.\n\nNow, you were suggesting:\n\n  if [ \".$FOR_UNIT\" \u003d\u003d \".1\" ] \u0026\u0026 [ \".$FOR_MDTS\" \u003d\u003d \".1\" ] \u0026\u0026 [ $(git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r HEAD build.gradle) ]\n\n\nI think this is not so correct. Note that apart of the build.gradle version bump, you could edit any file included in REGEX_FOR_MDTS and still get a FOR_MDTS \u003d\u003d 1 which would result in recommending a fast build incorrectly.\n\nInstead the code on patch 6/7 is more explicit looking for a positive match on the case we want to catch. Once we know that FOR_UNIT \u003d\u003d 1, we check the whole changeset, no filters, and search precisely for a single change in the midonetVersion line. Only if this matches will we allow the \"version bump\" mode. \n\nOtherwise it falls back to full build.",

      "message": "I might be wrong, but just thinking about it off the top of my head, I think a change to a different part of the build.gradle file that happened to have \"midonetVersion\" added would also count as a \"version bump only\" change with this grep.\n\nSo, \n\n  - \u0027rhelTarget \u003d \"7\"\n  + \u0027rhelTarget \u003d \"midonetVersion \u003d \"5.0.0-rc6\"\"\n\n(or anything similar) seems like it might still miss the full check.\n\nBasically we are checking that + and - are the same (so it\u0027s a single change, not an add or remove) and that the added portion has \"midonetVersion\" in it, but not checking that the removed portion also had midonetVersion in it.\n\nAgain, this is a very unhappy-path edge case, but I\u0027ve seen stranger things happen with vi and fat fingers before. :)  Should be caught in code review, sure, but just in the name of completeness...",

      "message": "The change in the example breaks the build.\n\nAnyway, yes, you can hack the recommendation by introducing a change that gets detected as a version bump AND does not break the build.  The only consequence here is that you might get a +1 from Jenkins. But reviewers will -2.\n\nHaving a more intelligent script that essentially does a code review of changes to build.gradle would be awesome, but IMO is out of scope here: the script\u0027s job is to offer recommendations for CI targets; detecting malicious patches is code reviewers job.",
