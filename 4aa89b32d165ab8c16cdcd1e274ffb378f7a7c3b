      "message": "I don\u0027t understand \u0027wildcarding\u0027, but here\u0027s how this should work: If the DSCP rule is set and has a value, this will replace the value in the simulated packet.  After the simulation is finished and when the packet egresses a port on the bridge, the packet diff is checked to see if any values are different, and if they are, a flow action is installed with the flow.  If the original value was the same as the DSCP value, the inequality operator in \u0027diffIp\u0027 would return false, and hence, no special flow action would be installed.  Is that what you were wondering about?",

      "message": "Okay, I think I understand what you were pointing out.  If a packet has a diff TOS field, this will reset it and install a flow with that setTOSKey-\u003edspMark action for all further flow matches.  However, if the simulated packet has the same TOS field, this will NOT install a setTOSKey action, because there will be no diff.  Therefore, all further flow matches will not have a setTOSKey action, and since there is no match on TOS field, those packets will flow straight through without having their TOS field changed (even if it\u0027s not the same as the dscpMark).\n\nThis indeed seems to be wrong behavior.",
