/**
 * An abstract base class for representing a binding between two objects. Both
 * objects have an 'ID', and one is referencing the other by holding the
 * referenced object's ID in its field. The two objects can actually be the same
 * object, recursively referencing itself. The referenced object may optionally
 * hold a 'back-reference' to the referencing object.
 *
 * A binding must also specify what should happen on deleting the referencing
 * object, which is one of the following:
 *
 *      CASCADE: Delete the bound referenced object.
 *
 *      CLEAR: Remove the bound referenced instance's back-reference to the
 *      referencing object.
 *
 *      ERROR: Do not allow the referencing object to be deleted unless all the
 *      back-references to it are removed.
 *
 * Eg. Bridge and Chain
 * A bridge's in-bound filter ID refers to a chain, and a chain has back-
 * references to all the bridges to which the chain is being applied.
 *
 * TODO: make protected once it's not required to expose it on the
 *       StorageService
