      * asynchronously. If the parent node doesn't exist the Observable will
      * immediately emit onError with a NoNodeException.
      *
      * Assuming the subscription happens at t0, the subscriber will immediately
      * receive one child Observable for each child node that is known at t0 by
      * the cache. These child Observables will in turn emit a single ChildData
      * with the latest known state of the child node.
      *
      * All child node removals happening at t > t0 will cause the corresponding
      * child observable to complete. All child node additions happening at
      * t > t0 will result in a new child observable primed with the initial
      * state being emitted to the subscriber.
      *
      * Connection management is delegated to the underlying PathChildrenCache,
      * which will deal with reconnections according to the policies and times
      * set in the given CuratorFramework.  When Curator gives up on a
      * connection all subscribers of this observable will be notified by
      * emitting an onError with a PathCacheDisconnectedException, as well as
      * all child observables emitted so far. Any new subscribers to the
      * Observable will immediately receive the same onError.
      *
      * All data notifications are executed on ZK's watcher thread.
