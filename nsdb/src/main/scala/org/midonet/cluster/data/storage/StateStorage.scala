/**
 * The [[KeyType]] enumeration defines how values can be written to a state
 * key.
 *  - [[KeyType.SingleFirstWriteWins]]
 *  Only one key value is allowed at a time. A client can add a new value only
 *  if the key has no value or if the current value belongs to the same client
 *  session. The new value can be different from the old value.
 *  - [[KeyType.SingleLastWriteWins]]
 *  Only one key value is allowed at a time. A client can always add a new value
 *  and it will overwrite any existing value, even if it belongs to a different
 *  client session.
 *  - [[KeyType.FailFast]]
 *  Same semantics as [[KeyType.SingleLastWriteWins]] except that state data is
 *  quickly removed when the entity that created them is deemed to be down.
 *  This is achieved by using a small ZooKeeper session timeout for this type of
 *  key.
 *  - [[KeyType.Multiple]]
 *  Multiple key values from different clients are allowed at a time. Keys
 *  supporting multiple values are always last write wins, where a value can
 *  be overwritten by a different client.

/**
 * A trait that complements the [[Storage]] trait with support for ephemeral
 * state data. They are added as key value pairs where "state" keys are
 * registered prior to building the storage.
 *
 * A class implementing this trait should allow the registration of zero or more
 * state keys per object class. In turn, this should give the capability to
 * add or remove state values for every key and object created in storage, using
 * that object's identifier.
 *
 * Depending on the [[KeyType]] a key may support a single or multiple
 * values. The state of an object is independent from its data and is isolated
 * for each host in a private ZooKeeper tree called namespace. Because a new
 * host can create state after an object has been created, the state paths are
 * created on demand when a hosts adds a value to a state key. However, it is
 * not possible to add a state value for an object that doesn't exist.
 *
 * For example, the state storage is used by the agent to add alive state to
 * existing hosts, which are stored separately from the host object. Since a
 * host can only be set alive by a single agent at a time, host alive uses
 * [[KeyType.SingleFirstWriteWins]], such that the first writing agent has
 * exclusive access to the state value.
 *
 * Likewise, the agent uses it to add active state to local exterior ports.
 * Since ports can be set as active on more than one host at a time, port active
 * uses [[KeyType.Multiple]], such that the state storage allows multiple values
 * for the same key.
