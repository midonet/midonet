/**
  * A container provider scans all classes of type T on the current classpath
  * with specified reflections instance, and annotated with a [[Container]]
  * annotation. The [[Container]] specifies a name and version for each
  * container class, and the provider ensures that the last version of each
  * container type is available for instantiation.
  *
  * A caller can create an instance of the given container type using the
  * `getInstance` method and the container name as specified in the [[Container]]
  * annotation. Instantiation uses Guice dependency injection, and towards this
  * end derived classes of the [[ContainerProvider]] need to provide an
  * implementation of the `injector` method which provides the appropriate
  * dependencies.
