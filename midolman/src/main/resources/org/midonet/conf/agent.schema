    htb_description = """
Midolman limits the amount of packets in flight in the system at any
given time. This prevents its internal queues from growing infinitely.
Additionally, midolman ensures that its processing capacity is shared
fairly among ports connected to the datapath. This, for example,
would prevent a single VM from setting up new flows at a rate that
would starve other VMs in the system.

This behaviour is achieved by routing packets that miss the datapath
flow table and rise to userspace through a Hierarchical Token Bucket.
This HTB is set up in such a way such that tunnel ports will get 50%
of the resources, and the remaining 50% is shared fairly among all
other ports (typically, VMs).

The rate at which the buckets are refilled is automatic and dynamic.
However the size of the buckets at each stage of the HTB can be tuned
through the settings below, increasing a bucket size will increase the
burstiness at which traffic can be queued before new tokens become
available.

Bucket size is measured in packets.

global_incoming_burst_capacity: size of the HTB root bucket

vm_incoming_burst_capacity: bucket size for VM ports
