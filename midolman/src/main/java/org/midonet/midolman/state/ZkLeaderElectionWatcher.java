/*
 * This class implements the leader election algorithm in Zookeeper.
 * What it achieves: picks a single node out of all registered nodes to
 * perform some task. If the designated node dies, a new one is automatically
 * chosen
 *
 * How to use:
 *  - pick a path where all your nodes will sync up. Then,
 *  - call "registerLeaderNode" with that path and a zk manager. the callback
 *     is executed on becoming the designated node.
 *  - you do NOT have to worry about re-registering when nodes go down. the
 *    process call handles all that for you.
