# Midolman limits the amount of packets in flight in the system at any
# given time. This prevents its internal queues from growing infinitely.
# Additionally, midolman ensures that its processing capacity is shared
# fairly among ports connected to the datapath. This, for example,
# would prevent a single VM from setting up new flows at a rate that
# would starve other VMs in the system.
#
# This behaviour is achieved by routing packets that miss the datapath
# flow table and rise to userspace through a Hierarchical Token Bucket.
# This HTB is set up in such a way such that tunnel ports will get 50%
# of the resources, and the remaining 50% is shared fairly among all
# other ports (typically, VMs).
#
# The rate at which the buckets are refilled is automatic and dynamic.
# However the size of the buckets at each stage of the HTB can be tuned
# through the settings below, increasing a bucket size will increase the
# burstiness at which traffic can be queued before new tokens become
# available.

# Bucket size is measured in packets.
