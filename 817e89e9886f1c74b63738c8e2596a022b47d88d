      "message": "In 1.9 the VIPs were added to the load-balancer. Since, 5.0 the VIPs are added to the pool. However, at the time we decided that we\u0027re going to support the API returning the VIPs for a load-balancer if needed (which is kind-of awkward), but you have the possibility of listing all VIPs for an LB without going pool-by-pool.\n\nSee: https://docs.midonet.org/docs/latest-en/rest-api/content/vip.html\n\nHowever, we removed the possibility of creating a new VIP for an LB, now you have to created for a pool. But we haven\u0027t removed that option from the CLI.",
