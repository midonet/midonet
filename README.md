## Virtualized networking for public and private clouds

**MidoNet** is a network platform that can be used to build arbitrary network
topologies on top of an existing IP network without having to modify it.

Today most people use MidoNet with OpenStack, but some are using MidoNet with
vanilla Linux hosts, others are working with container platforms like Docker,
Mesos, etc.

You do not need special hardware for using MidoNet, it is all based on software.

Network virtualization technology is used at cloud service providers and in
private clouds to encourage more dynamic and faster network usage and thus
allowing faster time to market for the applications of your customers running in
containers and/or virtual machines.

MidoNet allows you to directly connect to existing physical networks using
either special switch hardware containing an L2 hardware gateway software
(VTEP), or an L2 software gateway in MidoNet, which also support VLAN IDs.

The most interesting side effect of using a scalable, distributed system is the
economical savings in electricity and air conditioning.

Instead of sending all traffic through large proprietary boxes, the decisions
about the traffic of virtual machines are computed on the hypervisor
where the VM is located and traffic that should go to the Internet moves through
commodity servers acting as L3 gateways and L4 load balancers.

This way a cloud operator can scale out compute nodes and gateways while at the
same time being respectful to nature and the environment, avoiding wasted energy
and unnecessary cooling of large, often underutilized network appliances.

## About MidoNet

MidoNet supports virtual L2 switches, virtual L3 routing, distributed, stateful
source NAT and distributed stateful L4 TCP load balancing.

The core of the software is a flow simulator agent that gets installed on each
hypervisor and on gateway nodes responsible for north-south traffic.

While the agent uses the datapath from Open vSwitch, all other Open vSwitch
userland components are replaced and obsoleted by using MidoNet.

The traffic between virtual machines is encapsulated in tunnels (GRE or VXLAN)
which means the existing network does not have to be changed to use MidoNet's
network virtualization technology.
