## DESCRIPTION

Load balancers are MidoNet's load balancing elements compatible with LBaaS of
OpenStack.

A router is associated with a load balancer which contains pools and VIPs. A
pool is a group of pool members and the load balancer pick one of pool members
to balance the access to a specific IP address represented by the VIP. See the
following graph to understand their relationships.
