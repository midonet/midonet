It implies implicit agreement between the flowcontroller, and flowprocessor and the simulation threads.\n\nIt would be better to have a call like flowprocessor#newPartition() : Int, which the adds a partition to the flow processor and returns the index. This can then be called by the flowcontroller on initialization.",
