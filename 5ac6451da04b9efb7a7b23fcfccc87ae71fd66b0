      "message": "Yes, I now, but it seems that the HostMapper code was easier to extend if a VirtualDevice was created and to me was not clear if other entities (like TunnelZone) were true VirtualDevice or just classes to proxy ZOOM API in a convenient to create the (Simulation)Host. I will see it I can refactor the code to avoid defining it as a VirtualDevice.",

Also the Host entries already have a port_ids list, so I guess a potential extra entry per port is not affecting scalability (at least its big O complexity)",
