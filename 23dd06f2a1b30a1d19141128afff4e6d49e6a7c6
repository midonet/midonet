      "message": "Thanks Nicolas! However, I\u0027m not sure whether we can do this. The mapper should emit a port also, for example, when the port\u0027s chains have changed (such that to invalidate the flows for this port), even if the Port instance is equal to the previous one. I think that here `distinctUntilChanged` should do a deep comparison of all port members, including the chain. I\u0027m not sure though whether that\u0027s practical, plus we have to be very careful not to ignore needed notifications.",
