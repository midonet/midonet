(though not a big deal, I\u0027ve been trying to avoid midonet/cluster referencing neutron to give indication that it only cares about some database that has \u0027tasks\u0027 table.)\n\nI\u0027m also confused about the explanation.  I think you could just say \"Credentials for accessing the DB that contains the tasks table\", and not refer to Stackforge at all.",
