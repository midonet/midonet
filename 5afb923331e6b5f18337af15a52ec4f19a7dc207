      "message": "I think the idea whoever did this had was that by depending on 1.10 and conflicting with 1.11, it would only pick openvswitch-datapath-source if it was an old enough repo, otherwise it would use the newer linux image.\n\nAs I read it though, what it said to me is, if you can find an old enough openvswitch-datapath-source, prefer it over the linux-image that includes openvswitch.",
