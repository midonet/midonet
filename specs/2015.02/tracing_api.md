# Flow Tracing API

This document describes an API for enabling and disabling flow tracing
on a midonet cluster. When log tracing is enabled, all interactions of
the flow with the midonet agent are logged at the trace level.
Currently it is possible to enable these flow trace logs
agent-by-agent, using a JMX extension. The goal of this blueprint is
to allow administrators to enable tracing from a centralized
location. Note that this document does not cover the collection and
display of the flow trace log messages themselves. This is reserved
for future work. For now, log traces can be written to a local file on
the agent or sent to a remote ELK or Splunk instance.

## Motivation

The current method of enabling trace logging for flows is cumbersome
and labour intensive. The network administrator has to know which
hosts have ports attached to the device they want to trace on, and
then log into each host to enable logging via JMX. Only the network
administrator can enable traces as it requires direct access to the
agents. In a multitenant environment this becomes unfeasible, as a
host may be shared among multiple tenants, and any tenant enabling
trace would be able to view potentially sensitive information from
other tenants.

The motivation for this change is to allow users to create trace
requests from one place and view all traces they currently have
running. A side effect of this is that tenants will be only able to
setup trace requests on their own devices, thereby bypassing the
security concerns from the previous solution.

## User facing changes

A new resource will be created in the REST API, under
/midonet-api/traces.

### Creating a trace request

POST /midonet-api/traces

Parameters:
{ "deviceType" : "<BRIDGE, ROUTER or PORT>",
  "device"     : "<uri of bridge, router or port>",
  "condition"  : "<condition on which to trace for a given flow>",
  "limit" : "<max # of flows traced per host for this request>",
  "enabled" : "<whether to enable the trace from the start>" }

Returns UUID identifying the trace request

### Viewing an existing trace request

GET /midonet-api/traces/:traceId

Returns
{ "deviceType" : "<BRIDGE, ROUTER or PORT>",
  "device"    : "<uri of bridge, router or port>‚Äù,
  "condition" : "<condition>",
  "limit" : "<max # of trace logs per host>",
  "enabled" : "<whether the trace is currently enabled>",
  "creationTimestampMs" : "<when the request was created>" }

### Deleting a trace request

DELETE /midonet-api/traces/:traceId

It is important to note that creating a trace request through the REST
API does not automatically enable it.

### Enabling/Disabling a trace

PUT /midonet-api/traces/:traceId

Parameters:
{ "deviceType" : "<BRIDGE, ROUTER or PORT>",
  "device"     : "<uri of bridge, router or port>",
  "condition"  : "<condition on which to trace for a given flow>",
  "limit" : "<max # of flows traced per host for this request>",
  "enabled" : "<whether to enable or disable the trace>" }

Note that all fields other than "enabled" must match those of the trace
request that already exists in the system.

## Implementation details

Trace resources in the REST API map to trace znodes in
ZooKeeper. These are stored by the ZOOM library.

When a trace request is created a UUID is generated, which is used to
refer to the trace request for its lifetime. The trace request znode
contains the trace condition, the trace device, the max trace logs per
host and a field to signify whether the trace request is enabled or
not.

When a trace request is enabled, a rule is inserted into the infilter
chain of the device for which the trace request was made, and the
enabled flag in the znode is set to true. When a trace request is
disabled, the trace rule is removed and the enabled flag is set to
false.

When simulating the path of a packet, the midonet agent applies all
the rules in the infilter chains of each virtual device which the
packet would traverse. If any of these chains contains a trace rule,
the context is tagged with the id of that trace rule, and the
simulation is restarted. The second time through, the context will
skip the trace rule as it is already tagged with the id.

Simulation only occurs at the ingress hosts of a flow. To allow trace
logs to be generated at the egress host of the flow, when we enable
tracing for a context on the ingress host we also send a trace state
message to the set of interested hosts. The trace state message
contains a the 5-tuple of the packet, the id of the trace request and
the id of the flow, which is generated at the ingress host. We also
set a trace bit in the tunnel key of the packet being simulated, so
that when it reaches the egress host it will be thrown up into
userspace rather than being handled by the megaflow for the tunnel
key. The installed flow for the packet does not have this trace bit
set, so subsequent packets will traverse the underlay as normal. When
the packet does reach the egress host, it is matched against the trace
state to find the trace request id and enable tracing.

Flow trace logs are output using slf4j, which in our codebase
ultimately outputs to logback. Context information is added to the
trace logs using MDC. This information contains the cookie id, the
flow id, the trace request id and the host id.

## Performance Impact

When not enabled there is no performance impact from flow tracing.

When enabled for a flow, flow tracing has a comparable performance
impact as debug logging, though only for flows which match the
condition specified for the trace request. Log strings will be
generated for each trace, with implies string formatting which is
rather expensive. This will also generate more garbage for the garbage
collector to collect, so with a lot of traces minor collections will
run more often.

There is also a network performance impact. For each flow processed,
many flow messages will be transmitted to a remote node, likely more
than the size of the packet which is being processed for the flow.

Therefore it is important to be specific when specifying a match
condition for flow tracing so it only captures a small percentage of
your traffic.

## Testing

Unit tests will be created for individually testing the different
components.

## Documentation

REST API documentation will be provided for trace objects to the same
level as the REST API for existing resource types.

## Work Plan

The task breakdown is as follows:

- REST API
  - Trace resource type
  - API documentation
- ZooKeeper changes
  - Trace object type
  - Trace enabling/disabling
- Ingress/Egress matching
- Adding context to trace logs

This work will be implemented by Ivan Kelly <ivan@midokura.com>.
