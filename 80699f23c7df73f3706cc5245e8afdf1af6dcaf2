I think we can decide to use either the old or the new one, where:\n- if we use the old one, then the HostMapper should emit rcu.Host on its observable\n- if we use the new one, then the HostMapper stays as is, this method is not needed, and MM should be refactored to use the new devices.Host\n\nOtherwise, I don\u0027t see what is the advantage of converting:\nTopology.Host \u003e devices.Host \u003e rcu.Host \u003e simulation",
