      "message": "You commented that it was kept intentionally unspecified whether ZOOM would close the subscriptions by itself or not, but the above seems to mean that ZOOM will NOT (except when it\u0027s explicitly called to close) close subscriptions since it\u0027s not supposed to be watching to the version node. Am I understanding correctly.\n\nAlso, I suggest that you remove flush from Storage API but keep the implementation as is and expose it through a different / new API. Flush is being used by C3PO Minion Tests. So otherwise Jenkins will never pass.",
