      "message": "Wait, actually, now that I realize, this should not be in the bridge process() method, because a port filter could disallow these packets from getting to this point. I think it should be in \u0027packetIngressesPort\u0027, before the chain is applied. That\u0027s now in the coordinator because ports have now simulation code themselves (something we want to change eventually).",
