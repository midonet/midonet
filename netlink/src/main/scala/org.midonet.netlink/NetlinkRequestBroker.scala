/**
 * Class through which to make Netlink requests that require a reply. Do not
 * use this class to receive kernel notifications. It expects one or more
 * publisher threads to call the nextSequence(), get() and publishRequest()
 * methods, a single writer thread to call writePublishedRequests() and a single
 * reader thread to call handleReply().
 *
 * Synchronization:
 *
 * Publisher threads synchronize amongst themselves by doing a CAS on the
 * sequence field. They synchronize with the writer and reader threads through
 * the respective sequence fields (writtenSequence and readSequence). Note that
 * the read thread can advance faster than the write thread: after writing the
 * request, the writer still has to clear the buffer used to carry the request.
 * After claiming a sequence, a publisher thread can obtain a ByteBuffer wherein
 * to serialize the netlink request. It then publishes the request for writing
 * by marking the corresponding position of the publishedSequences array with
 * the high order bits of the sequence, i.e., those not used to index the array,
 * which count how many different requests a position has seen. A position is
 * only allowed to contain a new request once the write and read sequences have
 * advanced past it.
 *
 * The writer thread, starting at writtenSequence, writes all the subsequent
 * requests that have been published. After it's done, it updates that sequence
 * so that waiting publisher threads can progress.
 *
 * The reader thread reads the replies from the kernel. We optimize for the case
 * where the requests are received in the order they are written. A publisher
 * trying to claim a sequence has thus to wait for the reply to the oldest
 * request. When a reply is received, we clear the corresponding observer. At
 * the end of handleReply() we advance the readSequence by skipping over the
 * continuous completed requests, those that have gotten a reply or timed out.
 *
 * Timeouts:
 *
 * We support timing out a pending request. Note that this is not built into the
 * protocol nor is it supported by libraries such as libnl. They should be used
 * mostly to avoid stalling publisher threads when a request is not made but
 * no error is detected. We don't support timing out a request if we'll eventually
 * receive the reply: if the request is in position X and the reply arrives after
 * we have wrapped around to X again, it may be mistaken as the new reply.
 *
 * TODO: Use @Contended on some of these fields when on java 8
