Assuming that you always want to re-create /etc/midonet/midolman.conf, which I think is ok, you\u0027d want the following lines before the \u0027if\u0027 block:\n\nMIDO_CONF\u003d$TOP_DIR/midolman/conf/midolman.conf\ncp $MIDO_CONF ${MIDO_CONF}.edited\n\nand you want to keep the following lines inside here:\n\niniset ${MIDO_CONF}.edited cluster enabled true\niniset ${MIDO_CONF}.edited cluster tasks_db_connection \"mysql://localhost:3306/neutron?user\u003d${TASKS_DB_USER}\u0026password\u003d${TASKS_DB_PASSWORD}\"\n\nAnd then you want to put the following after the if block:\n\nsudo mv ${MIDO_CONF}.edited $AGENT_CONF_DIR/midolman.conf\n\nAND you want to move the following command after you do the \u0027mv\u0027 command above:\n\nrun_process midolman \"./gradlew -a :midolman:runWithSudo\"\n\nDoes that make sense?",
