      "message": "The referencing here still feels wrong. It\u0027s circular.\n\nHow about an object ContainerInstance, which has an immutable reference to the handler and the execution context. the handler then has a reference to the execution context. There\u0027s no circles, just a diamond.\n\nWhen starting a container, you can look up the previous instance by id, and reuse the execution context associated with it.",
