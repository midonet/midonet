I was suggesting that we don\u0027t need to change this at all because the extra dhcp option member variable always gets initialized to an empty ArrayList.  So why not just do:\n\nnew BridgeDhcpZkManager.Host(host.getMAC(), host.getIp(),\n                host.getName())\n\nBasically this file would be unchanged.",

      "message": "While this message is accurate, it is still weird that we would even mention passing in an empty array into this constructor when there is already a constructor defined above that does the same thing (but more concisely).  Perhaps suggesting that you use the other constructor is more helpful.",

      "message": "Let me explain why I find this undesirable. Before, you could have constructed this object as:\n\nnew Host(mac, ip)\n\nwhich is all you need in most cases for a DHCP host, but now this constructor is taken away and instead requires:\n\nnew Host(mac, ip, new ArrayList\u003cDhcpExtraOption\u003e())\n\nwhich is verbose and awkward.  Requiring an empty list for optional values to construct this object is undesirable to me.  If we must add this to a constructor, could we just add it to ONLY the one with the longest arg list (the one at the top)?  I personally think it\u0027s easier just to add \u0027setDhcpOptions()\u0027 method instead, and not touch the constructors at all, but that is just my opinion.",

      "message": "IMHO, having setExtraDhcpOptions (below) makes it unnecessary to require passing dhcp options in the constructor.  These are optional values after all.  I don\u0027t personally think you need two ways to set this member variable given its nature.  I think if you insist on having this in the constructor, it would be better to define a new one so that the old one can still be used without requiring this arg.",
