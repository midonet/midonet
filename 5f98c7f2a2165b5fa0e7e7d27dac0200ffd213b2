      "message": "As I commented on the chain mapper patch, I think these methods here should be simplified. In my opinion the TopologyBuilder should provide a set of simple createDevice methods that take a set of optional arguments, and return a device proto of the given type eliminating as much boilerplate as possible. The only place where we would need to test all fields would be a conversion test, and perhaps creating test devices for those tests should be done there, not here.\n\nIn this particular case, I believe the following set of methods should suffice isn\u0027t it?\n\n  createLiteralRule\n  createJumpRule\n  createForwardNatRule\n  createReverseNatRule\n  createChain\n\nAnd I also think we should add the corresponding matchers in TopologyMatchers",
