      "message": "It worth to provide some rule to what is considered to be Cluster Service and what it contains.\nAs I see it, there are 2 types of Services: \u0027platform services\u0027 and \u0027networking services\u0027. Platform services provides functionality that is not related to any specific Networking feature support (Topology view, Config management). Network Services are realization of some specific networking functionality (VxLAN Gateway) and it looks like sort of \u0027cluster hosted\u0027 agent that takes care of the required actions",

      "message": "Currently both network and platform services are cluster services.  We could make these categories more explicit, but of course it adds a bit more cost to explain and understand them. What would be the benefit of seeing them detailed, over just thinking of cluster services as a whole?",

      "message": "I see them as two quite different types of service that we may have different requirements with regards to execution/APIs/... \nThere is different type of Services supported by overall MidoNet system , once you consider Neutron API driven Services that are realized by agents via Model translation and distribution on top of Cluster. So for me it make sense to have explicit distinction, even though both Platform and Hosted Network services currently delivered in the same way",

      "message": "Sounds reasonable. Would you say that platform services offer potentially northbound APIs, whereas management services APIs (if any) will typically be East-West (meaning, some other internal service may fetch data from it, but won\u0027t be exposed publicly)?\n\nThat actually gives us a nicer direction for sharing Auth tools etc. I\u0027ll update.",
