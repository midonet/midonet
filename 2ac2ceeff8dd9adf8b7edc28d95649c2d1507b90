Platform services provides functionality that is not related to any specific Networking feature support (Topology view, Config management). Network Services are realization of some specific networking functionality (VxLAN Gateway) and it looks like sort of \u0027cluster hosted\u0027 agent that takes care of the required actions",

      "message": "Currently both network and platform services are cluster services.  We could make these categories more explicit, but of course it adds a bit more cost to explain and understand them. What would be the benefit of seeing them detailed, over just thinking of cluster services as a whole?",
